# SocNetAPI

## Description

This application is a Social Network API which uses Express.js, a MongoDB database, Mongoose ODM and Moment.js. Using this application users can share their thoughts and react to their friend's thoughts. Building this application I learned a lot about the flexibility of MongoDB/Mongoose, as well as the importance and value of a well placed `console.log()`. 


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
To use this application the user must first run an `npm install` within the terminal inside the SocNetAPI file to install all required packages. Then, the user should run a `node index.js` in the terminal to fire up the server. After that, navigate to Insomnia and input `http://localhost:3001/api/users` in the address to GET started!
